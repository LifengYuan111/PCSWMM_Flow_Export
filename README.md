## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This work demonstrates the use of the **Storm Water Management Model (SWMM)**â€”specifically **PCSWMM with IronPython scripting**â€”for simulating the fate and transport of *Bacillus anthracis* surrogate spores following hypothetical contaminant releases in an urban environment. The modeling approach supports emergency preparedness for biological agent incidents, enabling planners to:

- Visualize contaminant migration pathways
- Identify potential hotspot areas
- Evaluate how land use and rainfall intensity affect spore washoff

## ðŸ›  Key Components

- **Modeling Tool**: PCSWMM v7.5 using EPA SWMM 5.1.015 engine
- **Code**: Custom IronPython 2.7 script for exporting time-series spore data from selected conduits (`export_flow.py`)
- **Calibration**: Washoff coefficients were derived from observed spore concentrations on asphalt, grass, and concrete surfaces
- **Simulations**:
  - Field experiment release (3 rainfall events)
  - Hypothetical plume scenario (3 rainfall events)

## ðŸ”¬ Study Highlights

- Developed a high-resolution stormwater model with 80,000+ subcatchments and 220,000+ conduits
- Calibrated exponential washoff functions using real field data
- Demonstrated that concrete surfaces produced significantly higher spore washoff than asphalt or grass
- Identified critical pathways and outfalls affected under extreme precipitation
